# Story-Telling-with-Data

I have used R-Shiny Dashboard to build story around data...

I have showcased following visualizations in Dashboard:
# Data Overview
*Donut Chart - To see how data is distributed amongst genders
*Pie-Charts - To See how data is distributed amongst different age groups.
*Histogram - To find out where my data is scattered around/ On an average how many hours do people sleep.

# Sleep Analysis
*Animated Line Charts - Basis filters, how Sleep pattern has differed across time.
*Group Histogram - How men and women tend to sleep ? Do Men sleep more as compared to women ?
*Error Analysis - Line chart to demonstrate how error is correlated with data through time.
*Boxplots - To see how sleeping pattern differs for  men and women across different age-groups
